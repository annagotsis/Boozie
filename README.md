# Boozie

The ideal programming language for pursuing the Ballmer Peak.

## Summary

There exists a legend in the world of programming known as the Ballmer Peak. This fabled phenomenon grants a significant "level-up" with respect to their coding abilities at a particular range of blood alcohol content (BAC). Yet this territory of productivity is elusive, operating at a very narrow range of BAC values.

There's a relevant [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/) for this:

Our language is designed with this phenomenon in mind, to help facilitate programmers who wish to pursue this unicorn, by making it easy for even the most inebriated of workers to code efficiently!

### List of Features

- Pattern Matching (OCaml style)
- Static typing, static scoping
- String interpolation
- Curly braces for closure
- instead of semicolons, a burp (or for someplace else maybe comments are burp or belch)
- for each loops
- all integers are floats - lol

### Example Programs

Here are some examples, Boozie on the left, JavaScript on the right.

#### Variable Assignment
For variable assignment the types are inferred. Quick and easy! You can also have multiple variable assignment without all the brackets.
```

let beer, fruit = "Blue Moon", "orange"       let [beer, fruit] = ["Blue Moon", "orange"];                  

set cup = "Stein"                             const CUP = "Stein";  
```
