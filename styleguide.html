        <h1>Style Guide</h1>
        <p>We very deliberately don't wish to impose many rules upon users of our language. Indeed, a majority of our core design philosophy stems from a desire to remove these sorts of burdens from programmers who have been imbibing. But there are a small handful of conventions upon which we feel we need to take a formal stand. So bear with us...</p>

        <h3>Indent Levels &amp; Spacing</h3>
        <p>Without even opening the can (or potentially bottle, in our case) of worms that is the ongoing holy war between proponents of tabs and proponents of spaces, we feel that most contemporary languages use <em>waaaaaaaay</em> too much whitespace. Four spaces? No, no, no... we use <em><strong>TWO</strong></em>.</p>
        
        <h3>Variable Naming Conventions</h3>

        <h4><strong>General Naming Conventions</strong></h4>
        <p>While it's syntactically legal to define any variable beginning with an underscore, we follow JavaScript and Python conventions of reserving these identifiers for variables that are intended to be kept private and/or may change with future implementations.</p>

        <h4><strong>Placeholders &amp; Demonstrations</strong></h4>
        <p>We've all been through those asinine tutorials and demos that absolutely <em>must</em> declare their variables as "foo" and "bar." Taking a cue from Python's deliberate eschewal of these in favor of the Monty Python-themed "spam" and "eggs" (we're not too proud to admit from whom we've stolen good ideas), we favor beer references!</p>
        <p>Several of our code examples broadly illustrate this point: identifiers such as "beer," "cup," "brewery," and the like. In general, we leave the implementation details to the user, but - if ever you feel like using "foo," we strongly recommend "beer" instead!</p>
